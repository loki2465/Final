# Final
Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction
📋 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient will miss a scheduled healthcare appointment. Reducing no-shows improves clinical efficiency, saves costs, and ensures better patient care.

We use a Decision Tree Classifier trained on appointment data, and create a Power BI dashboard to uncover patterns in missed appointments (based on SMS reminders, age, and appointment day).

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook (for code execution)

🚀 Project Steps
Data Collection and Cleaning

Imported the appointment dataset.

Cleaned missing values, encoded categorical features, and engineered useful features like day of the week.

Model Building

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether an appointment will be a no-show.

Evaluated model performance on a test dataset (accuracy, confusion matrix).

Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard to analyze trends:

No-shows by age group

Impact of SMS reminders

Appointment day of the week analysis

Optimization Recommendations

Suggested sending reminders to high-risk patients.

Proposed flexible scheduling during peak no-show times.

📊 Deliverables

Insight Report (PDF): Summary of project steps, findings, and conclusions.

📈 Key Insights
Age is a major factor in predicting no-shows.

SMS reminders significantly reduce the chance of missed appointments.

Certain weekdays experience higher no-show rates — scheduling adjustments could help.

🏁 Conclusion
Predicting healthcare appointment no-shows using machine learning enables proactive scheduling and resource management. Combining predictive modeling and visualization leads to data-driven improvements in healthcare operations.
